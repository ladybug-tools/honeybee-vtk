Viewing an [HBJSON](tests/assets/gridbased.hbjson) generated from a model that ships with Ladybug Tools. You can send this HTML to someone and they will be able to open the see the same model.

```console
honeybee-vtk translate "path to hbjson file" --include-grids --include-sensors="vectors" --show
```

Exporting points colored based on the direction of the normals for apertures and grid sensors. This is useful for models with very high number of sensors or apertures.

```console
honeybee-vtk translate "path to hbjson file" --include-grids --include-sensors="points" --include-normals="points" --show
```

Saving the files in VTK format and then viewing in [Paraview Glance](https://kitware.github.io/paraview-glance/app/). This is useful if you prefer smaller file sizes. Use "xml" in file-type to export XML files. If you wish to share a model that you have formatted in Paraview Glance, click on "Save State" button in the navbar of Paraview Glance. This will download a .glance file that you can share with others and they will be able to load this file back in Paraview Glance and see the model the way you formatted it.

```console
honeybee-vtk translate "path to hbjson file" --folder="path to the target folder" --file-type="vtk"
```
