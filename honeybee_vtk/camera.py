            position: A tuple of three numbers that represent the x, y and z
                coordinates of camera in a 3D space. Defaults to (0, 0, 50). Which
                puts the camera 50 units off of ground (XY plane).
            direction: A tuple of three numbers that represent the x, y, and z
                components of a vector towards the aim of the camera.
                Defaults to (0, 0, -1). Which means the camera will look towards the

                Defaults to (0, 1, 0).

                Defaults to 60.
            type: Choose between a perspective and parallel view type. 'v' will set
                the perspective view and 'l' will set the parallel view. Defaults to 'v'
